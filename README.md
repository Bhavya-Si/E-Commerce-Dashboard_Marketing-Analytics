# E-Commerce-Dashboard_Marketing-Analytics
The E-commerce Orders and Marketing Analytics project provided a comprehensive, hands-on 
experience in applying data analytics and business intelligence concepts to a real-world industry 
context. Working with a self-curated dataset and developing an interactive Power BI dashboard 
enabled us to translate theoretical knowledge into practical insights, reinforcing both technical 
proficiency and business understanding. 

From a technical standpoint, we gained a deep understanding of data preparation, modeling, and 
visualization workflows. Tasks such as establishing a **star schema model**, **creating calculated 
columns**, and designing **complex DAX measures (for KPIs like CLV, CAC, ROI, and AOV)** 
enhanced analytical capabilities. Implementing advanced Power BI features, including **row
level security (RLS), dynamic filtering, custom tooltips, and bookmarks**, shows 
skills in creating user-centric, interactive dashboards. 
On the business side, the project gives data storytelling supports 
managerial decision-making. How metrics derived from sales and marketing data can 
reveal performance gaps, customer trends, and opportunities for operational improvement. The 
process of interpreting profitability patterns, campaign effectiveness, and customer loyalty 
indicators emphasized the importance of contextualizing numbers within broader strategic 
objectives. 
Equally significant was the collaborative learning experience. Dividing responsibilities between 
data cleaning, DAX formulation, and visualization design allowed us to simulate a real-world 
analytics team environment, improving coordination, time management, and problem-solving 
skills. 
Overall, this project not only enhanced our technical expertise in Power BI but also cultivated a 
data-driven mindset, demonstrating how business intelligence can transform raw data into 
actionable insights. It reaffirmed our belief that mastering analytical tools and frameworks is 
essential for thriving in today’s data-centric business landscape.
